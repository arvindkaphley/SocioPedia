*"Today, I’m presenting a prototype that demonstrates how Generative AI can assist in cybersecurity incident reporting.

The idea is simple: enterprise systems generate thousands of logs every day, but only a fraction indicate real threats. Manually reviewing these logs is time-consuming and error-prone.

In my prototype, logs are passed into a Generative AI model using a structured system prompt. The AI analyzes the entries, flags suspicious activity, and outputs a concise, Markdown-formatted incident report.

For example, a log showing a suspicious SQL injection attempt or an unusual outbound connection is automatically transformed into a clear report — highlighting the threat indicators, possible risks, and recommended next steps.

This approach doesn’t replace analysts, but it speeds up triage, reduces noise, and ensures consistency in incident reporting.

Through this prototype, I validated that Generative AI can serve as a powerful assistant in incident response, making security operations more efficient and scalable."*


Our Gen AI CoPilot for Incident Resolution leverages frontier AI models integrated within a Python-based Jupyter Notebook environment to assist IT security teams in analyzing, triaging, and resolving incidents faster. The system exposes its capabilities through a REST API, enabling seamless integration with existing monitoring and incident management platforms. By combining interactive experimentation in notebooks with scalable API endpoints, the CoPilot delivers contextual recommendations, automates repetitive resolution steps, and provides intelligent insights to accelerate mean time to resolution (MTTR). This architecture ensures both flexibility for analysts and enterprise-level deployment readiness.

On its own, this is cryptic and requires expert analysis. My prototype takes this log, sends it to a Generative AI model, and automatically produces a human-readable incident report like this:

*"This transformation reduces noise, highlights risks, and gives analysts actionable next steps immediately.

I validated this approach across multiple incidents, from failed logins to suspected SQL injections. The outcome shows that Generative AI is not replacing analysts, but acting as a force multiplier — automating first-level triage, reducing false positives, and delivering structured incident reports at scale."*
